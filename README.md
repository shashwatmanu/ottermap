# Ottermap  

## Overview  
This is a simple React application built for the Ottermap frontend developer intern task. The app consists of two pages:  

### 1. Form Page (First Route)  
- A search bar (non-functional for now)  
- A form with fields for **First Name** and **Mobile Number**  
- Saves the form data in state  
- Navigates to the second page upon submission  

### 2. Map Page (Second Route)  
- Displays the user's name in the center of the header  
- Integrates **OpenLayers** for map functionality  
- Allows users to **draw, edit, and delete polygons** on the map  

## Tech Stack  
- **React** (Frontend framework)  
- **React Router** (For navigation)  
- **OpenLayers (ol)** (For map functionality)  
- **Vercel** (For deployment)
